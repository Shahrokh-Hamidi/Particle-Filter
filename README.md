Tracking based on Particle Filtering
-	The surviving particles are chosen based on the Genetic Algorithm 
-	To perform the tracking, Kalman Filtering with Constant Velocity model has been implemented 
-	Detection can be performed based on Background Subtraction
-	The number of particles is 1000
-	The project has been coded in Python3.
