-	Tracking based on Particle Filtering
-	Kalman filtering with constant velocity model has been implemented
-	To detect the moving object background subtraction can be used. 
-	The number of particles is 1000 
-	The initial position of the particles are based on uniform distribution function so that all the pixels have the same chance to be covered by them
